We have developed a web and Android application for hospital management systems, aimed at providing users (patients, doctors, admins) with various features to streamline processes and save time. Users can conveniently perform actions directly from their devices, including booking appointments, requesting ambulance services, managing billing, scheduling medical tests with reports, consulting with doctors and receiving prescriptions, among others. Additionally, the application offers supplementary services such as blood donation, caregiver assistance, home treatment, and more. Users have access to their profiles and medical history, providing them with convenient and timely information. By incorporating these features, users can significantly reduce their efforts and save time.
